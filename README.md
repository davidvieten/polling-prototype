# SSL All-Star Voting System

## Overview

The **SSL All-Star Voting System** is a web-based platform designed to enable General Managers (GMs) of the SoCal Summer League (SSL) to vote for their players across various categories. The system ensures fair voting practices by preventing GMs from voting for their own players and supports a streamlined user experience.
